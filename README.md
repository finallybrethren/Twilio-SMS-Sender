Twilio-SMS-Sender

https://www.twilio.com/sms

This is an sms sender using the twilio sms api to send text messages to any mobile number.
Twilio provides basic code so all I did was modify it by adding input fields and a while-loop
to make it a bomber and figlet because hacker tools are supposed to have cool ascii art.
